# Chat bot Eliza

A psychiatric chatbot based on Weizenbuamâ€™s ELIZA to mimic the responses of a psychotherapist in a psychiatric interview. Created with the goal of exploring basic artificial intelligence.

Created a human-like response pattern that guides users to work through their own problems using Regex Pattern matching, substitution methodology.

Warning: created for educational purposes, not meant to replace an actual psychotherapist.

## Usage/Examples

```bash
HOW DO YOU DO. PLEASE TELL ME YOUR PROBLEM
input: I think everyone hates me.
Really, everyone?

Why do you mention your back?
input: because it makes me uncomfortable
Can you elaborate on that?
```
